# sys-botbase
A Nintendo Switch (CFW) sys-module that allows users to remote control their switch via sockets as well as read and write to a games memory. This can be used to create bots for games and other fun automation projects.

## Features:

    1. Absolute memory address
    2. Address relative to main nso base
    3. Address relative to heap base

### Screen Capture:

## Credits
- Big thank you to [jakibaki](https://github.com/jakibaki/sys-netcheat) for a great sysmodule base to learn and work with, as well as being helpful on the Reswitched discord!
- Thanks to RTNX on discord for bringing to my attention a nasty little bug that would very randomly cause RAM poking to go bad and the switch (sometimes) crashing as a result.
- Thanks to Anubis for stress testing!
